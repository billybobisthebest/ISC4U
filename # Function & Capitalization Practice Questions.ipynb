    "- After creating the header of the function we move on to the body and in the body, we create a new variable named 'math_for_spehre' and assign it to the formula for calculating the volume of the sphere. The formula, in this case, is [(4/3)(pi)(r**3)] or click this link to go to the formula https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/sphere-volume-area.html\n",
    "- Next we use the return statement to tell our function to end and what we also tell it to calculate 'math_for_spehre'\n",
    "- Lastly outside the function, we create a new variable called 'calculation_1' and assign it to the function and to call the function we only need to call the non-default-parameter/ argument in this case it was only 'a' which was our radius. We also use the round ( varabile_name, places_too_round_to)' function and we finally print calculation_1 to print the volume of a sphere."
